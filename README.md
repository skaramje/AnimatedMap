# AnimatedMap

This project creates weather stations dynamically on a map.  The code allows you to pick any country and display the stations in that country.  

To pick a country, change the country code on line 24 of Plot.js.  The code for countries can be found in data.js file.  

The weather stations were obtained from the openweathermap.org api.  

In order to use the code, please obtain an accessToken from mapbox.com and openweathermap.org (current weather data API).  Mapboxgl access token is required to be inserted on line 52 in between single quotes.  Openweathermap.org token is required to be inserted in line 41 in place of '{APIkey}'

Installation: Save the html, css, javascript and data.js files in one folder.  Drag and drop the html file in chrome browser to run the code.
